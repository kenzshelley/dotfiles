# Kenz Dotfiles

Installation: 
1. Install iterm the old fashioned way
2. `./setup.sh`
3. Open vim and run `PlugInstall`

...that's it, hopefully, but probably not. 

Things missing: 
* adding brew to the path
* material theme thing
* always tries to load work zshrc right now
* p10k messedup
* coc stuff
